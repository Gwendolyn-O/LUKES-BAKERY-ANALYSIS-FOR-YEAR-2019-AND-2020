Increase Promotion During Weekdays: Since weekends are already high in sales, consider running targeted promotions or discounts on weekdays (especially Tuesday) to boost sales.

Analyze Decline in Sales: Investigate reasons for the overall sales drop from 2019 to 2020. This could involve examining external factors (such as market conditions or COVID-19 impact) and internal factors (like product availability or changes in marketing strategy).

Product-Specific Strategies: Given that "Angbutter" is the top seller, it could be beneficial to introduce variations or complementary products. Meanwhile, identify and promote products with lower sales to improve their performance.
